I begin with separation of concerns making my code modular and separate UI from
Data.

Starting with my Data file I create an empty array so that I can eventually push
my household members in. I create a function that holds onto the input values of
the user, but before we use those values it goes through a validation ensuring
that age is not blank and it is not equal to zero or a negative number and also
relationship is picked.  Once that happens I create and hold on to my object
(person) and the properties are assigned the input values but the user.  Inside
this function I call my UI function which creates the elements and appends the
values to the page.  I also have the object pushed to the array. I then reset
the form and have an if statement in regards to the validation messages that are
created ensuring they are removed once you fill in the form correctly. On the
data I also created a simple function to return the array so that I can pass it
to my UI page.

On the UI page we have my event handlers.  The first you run into is the submit
button which begins with a preventDefault and then I have the array
JSON.stringify and I have the value show in the element that has a class of debug.
I also removed the display none style that was on it. Next I have a function that
creates elements and also shows the values of the data.  I also created a button
for when house hold members need to be removed.  I add an id property for the
members so that it would be easier for me to be able to remove them from the
array. Next event handler we have the add feature again start with the
preventDefault. Here i am holding on to the selected values from the user and
call my function from the data side. Next I have an event handler on my remove button
ensuring that the house hold member is being removed from the DOM and also from the
array by their ID.

That was the run down of my thought process.

Cheers!!!
